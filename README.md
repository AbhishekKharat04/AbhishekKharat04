Hi, I'm Abhishek 👋
Automation & Robotics Engineering Student | Robotics Software | Embedded Systems | ROS2 Learner
I build projects that combine robotics, embedded systems, and software, with a focus on developing real, working systems—not just simulations.
🔧 What I Do
Build sensor-based automation systems
Develop robotic mechanisms (pick-and-place, servo/gripper control)
Design components in Fusion 360 (CAD)
Program embedded logic using Arduino (C/C++)
Learn robotics software & simulation (ROS2, Gazebo)

Projects
🔹 Pick-and-Place Robotic Arm (3-DOF)
Designed CAD models in Fusion 360
Programmed servo sequencing for automated sorting
Implemented basic kinematics & object detection logic

🔗 Repo coming soon…

🔹 Home Automation System (Light & Fan Control)
Automated lighting/fan control using LDR & DHT11
Built relay-driven control system
Displayed real-time data on I2C LCD

🔗 Repo coming soon…
