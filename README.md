# Hi, I’m **Abhishek Kharat** 👋  
### Automation & Robotics Engineering Student | Embedded Systems | Robotics Software Trainee

I build embedded systems and robotics workflows that **solve real tasks**, not just follow templates. From servo-driven robotic arms to sensor-based automation setups, I work at the intersection of hardware and software.  
Currently strengthening my skills in **ROS2, Gazebo, and Computer Vision**, with a goal to move into autonomous and intelligent robotic systems.

## 🚀 Projects  
### 🔧 [Pick-and-Place Robotic Arm (3-DOF)](#)  
*Designed in Fusion 360 • Programmed on Arduino Mega*  
- Developed a 3-DOF robotic arm with a servo-driven gripper for sorting based on object colour and shape.  
- Created fabrication-ready CAD models for base, linkages, joints, and gripper using Fusion 360.  
- Programmed servo motion sequencing and control logic on Arduino Mega to perform pick-and-place operations.  
- More details → (link will follow).

### 🏠 [Home Automation System – Light & Fan Control](#)  
*Arduino UNO • LDR & DHT11 sensors • Relay control*  
- Developed a sensor-based automation system to control lighting and fan operation based on ambient light and temperature.  
- Implemented an I2C 16×2 LCD module to display real-time temperature, humidity, and light status.  
- Programmed Arduino logic for automatic actuation (“dark → light ON”, “temp > threshold → fan ON”) using relay-driven outputs.  
- More details → (link will follow).
